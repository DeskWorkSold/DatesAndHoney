Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase

Dear Apple App Review Team,

I hope this reply finds you well. I'm writing to discuss an issue we've encountered regarding our app's subscription model and its 
compliance with App Store guidelines.

Our app, Dates And Honey, is a B2B platform designed to serve business clients. We recently received feedback regarding Guideline 
3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase, specifically related to the use of payment mechanisms other than in-app purchase for 
membership subscriptions.

We understand and respect Apple's policies regarding in-app purchases. However, due to the nature of our app and the preferences of our 
business clients, we've implemented a payment system using Stripe to deposit funds into a user's wallet within the app. This wallet 
system allows our users to manage their finances conveniently within the app environment.

While users can use these funds to access various features and services within the app, including membership subscriptions, we've 
encountered limitations with integrating Apple Pay for in-app purchases. Our clients prefer the flexibility and familiarity of using 
Stripe, especially in a B2B context.

We'd like to highlight that our app caters primarily to businesses and professionals, rather than individual consumers. The subscription 
model we've implemented is tailored to meet the unique needs and workflows of our business clients, ensuring a seamless experience 
conducive to their operations.

We kindly request clarification on aligning our subscription model with Apple's guidelines while preserving the functionality and user 
experience valued by our business clients.


Guideline 4.0 - Design
Thank you for addressing the issue by revising the Sign in with Apple experience in your app and uploading a new build along with a demo 
video. We appreciate your prompt action in resolving this matter.

The revised Sign in with Apple experience now aligns with the design and user experience requirements outlined in Guideline 4.0. Users no 
longer need to provide their name and/or email address after using Sign in with Apple, as this information is already provided by the Authentication Services framework.

Your attention to detail ensures a consistent and seamless experience for users who choose Sign in with Apple to authenticate or log in 
to their accounts. Thank you for your cooperation in maintaining the quality and integrity of the user experience within our platform.

We value your input and are dedicated to ensuring the compliance and quality of our app on the App Store. If you have any further 
questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your continued support.

Warm regards,

Hamza Tahir
